# To-Do-App with React

[See the page](https://to-do-app-w-react.vercel.app/)

- I made a TO-DO-APP with React. User can add, remove or edit to-dos. 
- Also there is an alert box which shows alert after every user action. 
- I used localStorage to store the data. This way when user refresh the page user's to-do list will still remain.

### I learned how to use;
  - <b>Components</b>
  - <b>useState</b>
  - <b>useEffect</b>
  - import/export
  - <b>Props</b>
  - React <b>Developer Tool</b>
  - Destructuring props
  - array <b>map</b> method
  - <b>setTimeout</b> function
  - <b>localStorage</b>
